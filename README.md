## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `AMAZON_EMAIL`: Your Amazon login email
- `AMAZON_PASSWORD`: Your Amazon password
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR`: Directory to save downloaded invoices (default: `./downloads`)

### File Naming Convention

Downloaded files are named with the following pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD_amount_amazon_orderid_###.pdf
```

Example: `20250817_2469_amazon_123-4567890-1234567_001.pdf`

## Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your Amazon credentials secure
- The script uses your actual Amazon account, so use responsibly

### Rate Limiting
- The script includes random delays between 2-5 seconds to mimic human behavior
- This helps avoid triggering Amazon's bot detection systems

### Browser Behavior
- The script runs in non-headless mode so you can see what's happening
- You may need to solve CAPTCHAs manually if they appear
- The browser window will close automatically when finished

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not find orders page link"**
- Amazon's page structure may have changed
- Try manually navigating to your orders page when the browser opens

**"Keep me logged in checkbox not found"**
- This is normal and won't affect functionality
- The script continues without checking this box

**Login Issues**
- Verify your credentials in the `.env` file
- Check if two-factor authentication is enabled (may require manual intervention)
- Ensure you're using the correct Amazon.de account

**No invoices downloaded**
- Check if you have orders in the current year
- Some orders may not have invoices available for download
- Verify the date range in the console output

### Debug Mode

The script provides console output showing:
- Date range being processed
- Number of orders found on each page
- Download progress for each invoice
- Final count of downloaded invoices
